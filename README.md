# n-myft-ui [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/n-myft-ui.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/workflows/n-myft-ui)

Client side component for interaction with myFT.

There are two entry points (both for js and scss):

- myft
- myft-common

However, we are trying to transition to an approach where apps explicitly import just the individual components (from the `components/` directory) themselves.

These subdirectories may contain a README. If not, please speak to the myft team about how to use them.

## Making changes

n-myft-ui provides the CSS, JS and most templates for the myFT components on FT.com. We use semver to control rollout of the code.

As of August 2017, The following apps use n-myft-ui:

- next-front-page
- next-stream-page
- next-article
- next-myft-page
- next-tour-page
- next-video-page
- next-search-page

When you merge to main, you should make a new release and then roll it out to the apps so that there aren't missing dependencies.

If you are making a major change, you will need to update the package.json files for the above apps. For minor and patch updates, you can rebuild without cache from CircleCI.
